# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions are supported for vulnerability reports. However, if you find a vulnerability in some really old version, it is possible that it has already been fixed in a newer version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, you can report it via Issues, where I will check it out. My usual response time is < 1 work week.
